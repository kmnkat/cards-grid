## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Thanks to this challenge I learned more about flexbox. I used it with `min-width` attribute to avoid writing too much media queries.

```css
.main-window {
  display: flex;
  width: 65%;
  min-width: 46rem;
	...
}
```
